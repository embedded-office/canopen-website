title: Usage of Timed Action in the Application
description: The CANopen Stack library provides a service for efficient handling of timed actions.

# Timed Actions

## CANopen Timer

The CANopen stack provides service functions for performing timed actions on the application or the profile-specific events. For timed actions the service function group COTmrâ€¦() is provided.

### Event Time Base

To establishing a constant time base, the CANopen stack provides a service function. For generating a time base, the following line should be placed in a hardware timer interrupt service function, which is called periodically:

```c
COTmrService(&demo);    /* trigger time event     */
```

The following diagram shows the internal behavior of this service:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant H as Hardware Timer
  participant T as demo.Tmr
  H->>+T: COTmrService()
  alt elapsed timer
  note over T: store elapsed timer
  end
  T-->>-H: ok
```

### Action Processing

The CANopen stack handles the storage and order of timed actions internally. For the execution of the timed functions a service function is provided.
For processing the elapsed timer actions, the following line should be placed in a loop within the background function:

```c
COTmrProcess(&demo);    /* process timed action(s)  */
```

The following diagram shows the internal behavior of this service:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Application
  participant T as demo.Tmr
  A->>+T: COTmrProcess()
  loop all elapsed timer
  T->>+A: call action callback
  A-->>-T: ok
  end
  T-->>-A: ok
```

*Note: The CANopen stack uses the timed actions for standardized timed actions. In this case the shown ActionCallback function is an internal CANopen stack function.*
