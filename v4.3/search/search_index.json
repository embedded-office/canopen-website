The pointer to the object entry will NOT change during runtime in a static object dictionary. Important The CANopen Stack relies on a binary search algorithm to ensure that object dictionary entries are found quickly. Because of this, you must keep the index / subindex of all entries in the object dictionary sorted in ascending order.

When using an RTOS, the CANopen node processing from within a separate task is possible, too. In this case, the blocking mode is suitable for most applications: void CanRxTask ( void * arg_p ) { CO_NODE * node = ( CO_NODE * ) arg_p ; /* task parameter is a ptr to */ /* CANopen node object */ while ( 1 ) { /* endless RTOS task loop */ CONodeProcess ( node ); /* wait and process CAN frames */ } } CONodeStart() # The node will change into the PRE-OPERATIONAL state and is ready for communication. Prototype void CONodeStart ( CO_NODE * node ); Arguments Parameter Description node pointer to node object Returned Value none Example The following example shows the typical startup of a CANopen node AppNode with the specification AppSpec: CO_ERR err ; : CONodeInit ( & AppNode , ( CO_NODE_SPEC * ) & AppSpec ); err = CONodeGetErr ( & AppNode ); if ( err == CO_ERR_NONE ) { CONodeStart ( & AppNode ); } else { /* error handling and diagnostics */ } : CONodeStop() # This function removes the CANopen node from the CAN bus interface. To reactivate a stopped CANopen node, the functions CONodeInit() and CONodeStart() must be called again. Prototype void CONodeStop ( CO_NODE * node ); Arguments Parameter Description node pointer to node object Returned Value none Example The following example shows the sequence for restarting a CANopen node AppNode. Assuming the CANopen stack is initialized and started before, we can stop and re-initialize the stack to reset the node completely. : CONodeStop ( & AppNode ); : /* do something with stopped CANopen node */ : CONodeInit ( & AppNode , ( CO_NODE_SPEC * ) & AppSpec ); err = CONodeGetErr ( & AppNode ); if ( err == CO_ERR_NONE ) { CONodeStart ( & AppNode ); } else { /* error handling and diagnostics */ } : Attention The shown example is NOT identical to the standard node reset which can be requested from the CANopen master or via the API function CONmtReset() .

Functional Specification # This example is the first of two writings to achieve a flexible and comfortable way of managing CANopen device software with dynamically generated object dictionaries during runtime.

For this reason, the manuals and templates declare the object dictionary storage as a const array which is placed into FLASH memory. For an estimation of how big the difference is, we have a quick look into the manual. The manual explains that each object dictionary entry needs 3 x 32bit values. Therefore, at an object dictionary with 256 object entries, we talk about: 256 * 12 Byte = 3 kByte In case of a static object dictionary, the CANopen stack stores the entire dictionary (including pointers to the changing data) in non-volatile memory. On the dynamic side, the CANopen stack stores the object dictionary in RAM, along with the changing data. The use of pointers to the changing data is optional. Note, the term \" dynamic \" means that we can create and change an object entry within the object dictionary during runtime up to a defined amount of object entries. The allocation of the required memory is still \" static \" - we don't need (and want) to use dynamic memory allocation in embedded systems with all the well-known drawbacks. Finally: We can improve the flexibility of our CANopen application software when working with a dynamic object dictionary. Module: app_dict # The object dictionary is an array of object entries.

First, we define a structure for holding the variable data of the dynamic object directory: typedef struct { CO_OBJ * Root ; uint32_t Length ; uint32_t Used ; } OD_DYN ; The member Root will hold the start address of the object dictionary. The member Length stores the maximal number of object entries in the object dictionary, and the member Used will hold the current number of used object entries.

With this example, we will have a look at using the dynamic CANopen Dictionary functions. We will see, how powerful these little functions are and how we can use them to get a dynamic Quickstart application. For details of the object entries, please have a look to the example Quickstart . Overview # We should have a short look into the Quickstart example as well. The following list summarizes the needed Object Directory entries. Object Entries, mandatory in CiA DS301: Device Type (Index 1000h) Error Register (Index 1001h) Heartbeat Time (Index 1017h) Identity Object (Index 1018h) SDO Server (Index 1200h) Object Entries, optional in CiA DS301 but needed by our demo: Transmit PDO Communication (Index 1800h) Transmit PDO Mapping (Index 1A00h) Manufacturer specific object entry for this demo: Clock Data (Index 2100h) Create Object Entries # First, we will take a look at all CiA DS301 object entries one by one. After getting these building blocks, we will combine them into a function, which creates our complete Object Directory. Device Type # The device type is a 32bit value, which identifies the CANopen device. Due to the fact, that our demo is not a real CANopen device, we store a constant 32bit dummy value (0x00000000) in this entry. ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1000 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x00000000 )); We choose the additional flags CO_OBJ_D__R_ to store the data directly ( D ) in the object entry and allow read access ( R ) from the communication interface. Error Register # The error register is an 8bit value, which holds the error register flags. The CANopen EMGY module manages the single error register flags. ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1001 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & ErrReg )); For this entry, we choose the additional flags CO_OBJ___PR_ to store a pointer to the data in the object entry ( _ instead of D ), allow the PDO mapping ( P ) and allow read access ( R ) from the communication interface. Heartbeat Time # The heartbeat producer is a 16bit value, which holds the time in ms between two heartbeats. The entry is a system type, which injects the heartbeat callback functions into this entry. The callback functions are responsible for the system behavior when reading or writing this entry. ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1017 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_THEARTBEAT , CO_DATA_SET_REG ( & HbTime )); For the system type CO_THEARTBEAT we must choose the storage of a data pointer in the object directory ( _ instead of D ). To get a system, which conforms to CiA DS301, we disallow the PDO mapping ( _ instead of P ) and allow read ( R ) and write ( W ) access from the communication interface. Therefore we set the additional flags: CO_OBJ____RW . Identity Object # The identity object is a structure of detailed node information. Due to the fact, that our demo is not a real CANopen device, we store a constant 32bit dummy value (0x00000000) in the mandatory entry at Sub-index 01h. ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x01 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x00000000 )); The subindex 00h holds the highest supported subindex in this index as a constant 8bit value. SDO Server Function # We encapsulate the SDO server communication object entry in a separate function. This function allows us to add multiple SDO servers with a smile. The subindex 01h is the COB-ID for the SDO request. The subindex 02h holds the COB-ID for the SDO response. Note: The CiA DS301 specifies for SDO server #0 the fixed COB-IDs: SDO request : COB-ID = 600h + NodeID SDO response : COB-ID = 580h + NodeID For all additional SDO servers (#1 .. #127) we can specify the COB-IDs. To get full flexibility and highest possible guidance by the function, we define the following function: static void ODCreateSDOServer ( OD_DYN * self , uint8_t srv , uint32_t request , uint32_t response ) { if ( srv == 0 ) { request = ( uint32_t ) 0x600 ; response = ( uint32_t ) 0x580 ; } ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1200 + srv , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x02 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1200 + srv , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_DN_R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( request )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1200 + srv , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_DN_R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( response )); } We choose the additional flags for the request and response identifiers to allow the storage of the identifiers independent of the used CANopen node ID. The node ID may change over time, and we don't want to update all depending object entries. Well, we can realize this by enabling the node ID flag N in the flags to remove the current node ID while writing and adding the current node ID while reading the object entry. TPDO Communication Function # Now we want to setup the transmit PDO (TPDO) communication object entry with a similar service function. This static PDO communication index array contains powerful settings. For details on the influence on the transmission behavior of every single subindex, please have a look into the CiA DS301 specification. static void ODCreateTPDOCom ( OD_DYN * self , uint8_t num , uint32_t id , uint8_t type , uint16_t inhibit , uint16_t evtimer ) { ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1800 + num , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x05 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1800 + num , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_DN_R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( id )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1800 + num , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( type )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1800 + num , 3 , CO_UNSIGNED16 | CO_OBJ_D__RW ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( inhibit )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1800 + num , 5 , CO_UNSIGNED16 | CO_OBJ_D__RW ), CO_TEVENT , ( CO_DATA )( evtimer )); } Note, that the subindex 04h is missing in this array. This gab is specified in the CiA DS301 for backward compatibility reasons. Furthermore, the subindex 00h states the highest accessible subindex (05h) and NOT the number of entries. This definition is a small pitfall when building this object entry. TPDO Mapping Function # The PDO mapping for the TPDOs needs an array with the mapping information as an argument to our service function. The mapping information is specified in CiA DS301 and is very similar to the key information of an object entry: Index : 16bit value (0000h to FFFFh) Subindex : 8bit value (0 to 255) Width : 8bit value with the number of bits (e.g., 8, 16 or 32) For building this mapping information, we can use the well known CO_KEY(..) macro where we use the 3 rd argument with the number of bits. static void ODCreateTPdoMap ( OD_DYN * self , uint8_t num , uint32_t * map , uint8_t len ) { uint8_t n ; ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1A00 + num , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( len )); for ( n = 0 ; n < len ; n ++ ) { ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1A00 + num , 1 + n , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( map [ n ])); } } This function will work correctly, but you can improve it with some guidance checks. The CANopen stack supports the number of bits 8, 16, and 32. Other values are not supported. Furthermore, the sum of all bits could be checked to be lower or equal to 64 bits. Create Directory Function # Now we are ready for building our dynamic object directory for the quickstart project smartly and efficiently: static uint8_t Obj1001_00_08 ; static uint32_t Obj2100_01_20 ; static uint8_t Obj2100_02_08 ; static uint8_t Obj2100_03_08 ; : static void ODCreateDict ( OD_DYN * self ) { uint32_t map [ 3 ]; Obj1001_00_08 = 0 ; ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1000 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x00000000 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1001 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj1001_00_08 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1005 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x80 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1017 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED16 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 4 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 3 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 4 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )); ODCreateSDOServer ( self , 0 , CO_COBID_SDO_REQUEST (), CO_COBID_SDO_RESPONSE ()); ODCreateTPDOCom ( self , 0 , CO_COBID_TPDO_DEFAULT ( 0 ), 254 , 0 , 0 ); map [ 0 ] = CO_LINK ( 0x2100 , 1 , 32 ); map [ 1 ] = CO_LINK ( 0x2100 , 2 , 8 ); map [ 2 ] = CO_LINK ( 0x2100 , 3 , 8 ); ODCreateTPdoMap ( self , 0 , map , 3 ); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x2100 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 3 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x2100 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj2100_01_20 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x2100 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj2100_02_08 )); ODAddUpdate ( self , CO_KEY ( 0x2100 , 3 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), CO_TASYNC , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj2100_03_08 )); } Note, in the marked line we use the system type CO_TASYNC to specify the manufacturer specific trigger event \"on change\" for this object entry. This setting results in the transmission of any TPDO which holds a communication type 254 and a mapping entry for this signal, if the node is in operational mode. For our demo, this results in the transmission of the TPDO with the clock values every second. Starting the Node # For setup and starting a CANopen node, we can now integrate the functions to a startup sequence: #define APP_OBJ_N 128 : static OD_DYN DynDict ; static CO_OBJ ClockOD [ APP_OBJ_N ]; : struct CO_NODE_SPEC_T AppSpec = { APP_NODE_ID , /* default Node-Id */ APP_BAUDRATE , /* default Baudrate */ & ClockOD [ 0 ], /* pointer to object dictionary */ APP_OBJ_N , /* object dictionary max length */ & AppEmcyTbl [ 0 ], /* EMCY code & register bit table */ & TmrMem [ 0 ], /* pointer to timer memory blocks */ APP_TMR_N , /* number of timer memory blocks */ APP_TICKS_PER_SEC , /* timer clock frequency in Hz */ & AppDriver , /* select drivers for application */ & SdoSrvMem [ 0 ] /* SDO Transfer Buffer Memory */ }; : void ClkStartNode ( CO_NODE * node ) { /* Clear all entries in object dictionary */ ODInit ( & DynDict , & ClockOD [ 0 ], APP_OBJ_N ); /* Setup the object dictionary during runtime */ ODCreateDict ( & DynDict ); /* Create a node with generated object dictionary */ CONodeInit ( node , & AppSpec ); } This function will generate a (temporary) node specification, initializes our new dynamic object directory and initializes the CANopen node with this specification. To integrate this in the delivered quick start demo, the only line we must change is the initialization of the specified CANopen node: void main ( int argc , char * argv []) { : /* CONodeInit(&Clk, (CO_NODE_SPEC *)&AppSpec); OLD */ ClkStartNode ( & Clk ); /* NEW */ : } Well, that's it.

The source files are included in the directory example/quickstart/app and should be followed during reading this article. In this example, we will create a CANopen Clock . While this clock node is not intended for serious applications, the example illustrates the key principles of development using the CANopen Stack. Functional Specification # The CANopen clock will only run if the device is switched to operational mode. The object dictionary will be updated every second with the new time. In operational mode, the node will transmit a process data object ( TPDO ) whenever the object dictionary entry \"second\" ( 2100h:03 ) is changed. The service data object server ( SDOS ) will allow access to the device information contained within the object dictionary. Object Dictionary # To keep the software as simple as possible, we will use a static object dictionary. In this case, the object dictionary is an array of object entries, declared as a constant array of object entries of type CO_OBJ . The object dictionary is declared in the file clock_spec.c : : /* define the static object dictionary */ const CO_OBJ ClockOD [] = { : /* here is your object dictionary */ : CO_OBJ_DIR_ENDMARK /* mark end of used objects */ }; /* set number of object entries */ const uint16_t ClockODLen = sizeof ( ClockOD ) / sizeof ( CO_OBJ ); : Mandatory Object Entries # The object dictionary must hold at least the following mandatory object entries: Index:sub Type Access Value Description 1000h:00 UNSIGNED32 Const 0 Device Type 1001h:00 UNSIGNED8 Read-only 0 Error Register 1005h:00 UNSIGNED32 Const 0x80 COB-ID SYNC 1017h:00 UNSIGNED16 Const 0 Heartbeat Producer 1018h:00 UNSIGNED8 Const 4 Identity Object 1018h:01 UNSIGNED32 Const 0 - Vendor ID 1018h:02 UNSIGNED32 Const 0 - Product code 1018h:03 UNSIGNED32 Const 0 - Revision number 1018h:04 UNSIGNED32 Const 0 - Serial number Remember For complex object dictionary entries (e.g. 1018h ), subindex 0 holds the highest subindex of this object. Info The values shown for 1018h are only dummy values. Vendor IDs are managed by CiA, and each registered company is assigned to a globally unique value. These mandatory entries are added with the following lines of code: : { CO_KEY ( 0x1000 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1001 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ____R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj1001_00_08 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1005 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x80 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1017 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED16 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 4 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 3 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1018 , 4 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0 )}, : Important The CANopen Stack relies on a binary search algorithm to ensure that object dictionary entries are found quickly. Because of this, you must keep the index / subindex of all entries in the object dictionary sorted in ascending order. Most of these entries are constant, and their values can be stored directly inside the object dictionary. This is not the case for the error register object 1001h . This entry is read-only, but can be changed by the node. We need to declare a global variable to contain the runtime value of the entry: uint8_t Obj1001_00_08 = 0 ; A pointer to this variable is stored in the corresponding object dictionary entry. This entry must be marked as CO_OBJ____R_ instead of CO_OBJ_D__R_ to let the stack know that this entry contains a pointer instead of a direct value. Important When using architectures with pointer types lower than 32bit (e.g. 16bit microcontrollers), you can store only values up to the pointer width directly in the object dictionary. For larger values declare a constant variable and place a pointer to this constant into the object dictionary: const uint32_t Obj1000_00_32 = 0x00000000L ; and : { CO_KEY ( 0x1000 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj1000_00_32 )}, : SDO Server # The settings for the SDO server are defined in CiA301 and must contain the following object dictionary entries: Index:sub Type Access Value Description 1200h:00 UNSIGNED8 Const 2 Communication Object SDO Server 1200h:01 UNSIGNED32 Const 600h + node ID - SDO Server Request COBID 1200h:02 UNSIGNED32 Const 580h + node ID - SDO Server Response COBID Info The predefined COBIDs are dependent on the actual node ID. For this reason, the CANopen stack allows you to specify entries whose value depends on the current node ID at runtime. This behavior is specified using the CO_OBJ__N___ flag. The following lines add the SDO server entries to the object dictionary: : { CO_KEY ( 0x1200 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 2 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1200 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_DN_R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( CO_COBID_SDO_REQUEST ())}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1200 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_DN_R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( CO_COBID_SDO_RESPONSE ())}, : Application Object Entries # Next, we need to add some application-specific object entries to support the clock-functionality of the example: Index:sub Type Access Value Description 2100h:00 UNSIGNED8 Const 3 Clock Object 2100h:01 UNSIGNED32 Read Only 0 - Hour 2100h:02 UNSIGNED8 Read Only 0 - Minute 2100h:03 UNSIGNED8 Read Only 0 - Second Info These entries are placed within the manufacturer-specific area (from 2000h up to 5FFFh ) and can be chosen freely (see CiA301). Entries outside of this range cannot be chosen freely, and should conform to the various CiA standards and profiles (e.g. CiA301 for communication profile area, CiA401 for generic IO modules, etc). These entries are created using the following lines of code: : { CO_KEY ( 0x2100 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 3 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x2100 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj2100_01_20 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x2100 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj2100_02_08 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x2100 , 3 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), CO_TASYNC , ( CO_DATA )( & Obj2100_03_08 )}, : Info The type CO_TASYNC for the object entry 2100h:03 indicates the transmission of all PDOs, which includes this object. We use this mechanism to achieve the PDO transmission on each write access to the second. We also need to create three global variables to hold the runtime values of the clock object: uint32_t Obj2100_01_20 = 0 ; uint8_t Obj2100_02_08 = 0 ; uint8_t Obj2100_03_08 = 0 ; TPDO Communication # The communication settings for the TPDO must contain the following object entries: Index:sub Type Access Value Description 1800h:00 UNSIGNED8 Const 2 Communication Object TPDO #0 1800h:01 UNSIGNED32 Const 40000180h - PDO transmission COBID (no RTR) 1800h:02 UNSIGNED8 Const 254 - PDO transmission type Info The CANopen stack does not support remote CAN frames as they are no longer recommended for new devices. The use of RTR frames in CANopen devices has been deprecated for many years now. Bit 30 in 1800h:01 indicates that remote transfers are not allowed for this PDO. The CAN identifier 180h + node-ID is the recommended value from the pre-defined connection set. See the following lines in the object dictionary: : { CO_KEY ( 0x1800 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 2 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1800 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_DN_R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( CO_COBID_TPDO_DEFAULT ( 0 ))}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1800 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 254 )}, : TPDO Data Mapping # The mapping settings for the TPDO must contain the following object entries: Index:sub Type Access Value Description 1A00h:00 UNSIGNED8 Const 3 Mapping Object TPDO #0 1A00h:01 UNSIGNED32 Const 21000120h - map: 32-bit clock hour 1A00h:02 UNSIGNED32 Const 21000208h - map: 8-bit clock minute 1A00h:03 UNSIGNED32 Const 21000308h - map: 8-bit clock second How we get these values is explained in section configuration of PDO mapping . This way of defining the payload for PDOs is part of the CiA301 standard and leads us to the following lines in the object dictionary: : { CO_KEY ( 0x1A00 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 3 )}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1A00 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( CO_LINK ( 0x2100 , 0x01 , 32 ))}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1A00 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( CO_LINK ( 0x2100 , 0x02 , 8 ))}, { CO_KEY ( 0x1A00 , 3 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( CO_LINK ( 0x2100 , 0x03 , 8 ))}, : EMCY Error Specification # We use in the application abstract EMCY error identifiers ( 0 to Number of EMCY - 1 ). To simplify maintenance, we should define these identifiers as enumerations. Refer to the file clock_spec.h for more detail: enum { APP_ERR_ID_SOMETHING = 0 , APP_ERR_ID_HAPPENS , APP_ERR_ID_NUM /* number of EMCY error identifiers in application */ }; Info With these enumerations in place, we can call the EMCY service functions in our application (e.g. in timer callback function like: COEmcySet(&node->Emcy, APP_ERR_ID_HOT, 0); ). EMCY Codes # The CANopen stack behavior for each of these EMCY error identifier is defined in a EMCY table. Here we define the EMCY code and the error register bit correlation. We don't use them in the simple clock application, but an example definition is shown in clock_spec.c : static CO_EMCY_TBL AppEmcyTbl [ APP_ERR_ID_NUM ] = { { CO_EMCY_REG_GENERAL , CO_EMCY_CODE_GEN_ERR }, /* APP_ERR_CODE_SOMETHING */ { CO_EMCY_REG_TEMP , CO_EMCY_CODE_TEMP_AMBIENT_ERR } /* APP_ERR_CODE_HOT */ }; The constants CO_EMCY_REG_... for the error register bits and CO_EMCY_CODE_... for the EMCY code base values are the specified values out of the CANopen specification. Warning When using pure numbers, check the possible range for the error register bits (8bit) and the EMCY code (16bit). Node Specification # The main settings of the node are configured inside the CO_NODE_SPEC struct. This struct will not be modified at runtime, so it can be declared as a constant, reducing RAM usage. The CANopen node needs some memory buffers for dynamic operations. These two buffers are statically allocated, and a pointer is stored inside the CO_NODE_SPEC struct.

Because of this, you must keep the index / subindex of all entries in the object dictionary sorted in ascending order. Most of these entries are constant, and their values can be stored directly inside the object dictionary. This is not the case for the error register object 1001h . This entry is read-only, but can be changed by the node. We need to declare a global variable to contain the runtime value of the entry: uint8_t Obj1001_00_08 = 0 ; A pointer to this variable is stored in the corresponding object dictionary entry. This entry must be marked as CO_OBJ____R_ instead of CO_OBJ_D__R_ to let the stack know that this entry contains a pointer instead of a direct value. Important When using architectures with pointer types lower than 32bit (e.g. 16bit microcontrollers), you can store only values up to the pointer width directly in the object dictionary.

App , ( uint8_t * ) & ParaDef . App , CO_RESET_NODE , ( void * ) \"app.txt\" , CO_PARA___E }; The following descriptions explains the details of the table members: The parameter group size [ uint32_t ] shall be set to the number of bytes within the parameter group memory area The start address of the parameter group memory area [ uint8_t * ] shall be set to the first address of the parameter group memory The reset type [ CO_NMT_RESET ] shall be set to one of the following values: Reset Type Description CO_RESET_COM parameter group shall be set to the stored values on communication reset CO_RESET_NODE parameter group shall be set to the stored values on node reset The pointer to the identification [ void * ] of this parameter group is not used by the CANopen stack. This member is intended to identify the different parameter groups within the application callback functions, related to the parameter handling. Any type of identification may be used for this purpose. In the shown example, an identification string is used. The parameter group feature indication [ uint32_t ], which is returned on a simple object entry read access, shall be set to one of the following values: Parameter Feature Description CO_PARA____ parameter group is disabled CO_PARA___E parameter group is enabled and will be stored on command CO_PARA__A_ parameter group is enabled and will be stored autonomously CO_PARA__AE parameter group is enabled and will be stored on command and autonomously Note: \"autonomously\" means without CANopen network interaction; e.g. the application is responsible for the storage of these parameter groups. The object entries, handling the saving and restoring of parameters, shall be set for the example to the following values: { CO_KEY ( 0x1010 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x03 ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1010 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TPARA , ( CO_DATA )( & AllParaObj ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1010 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TPARA , ( CO_DATA )( & ComParaObj ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1010 , 3 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TPARA , ( CO_DATA )( & AppParaObj ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1011 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x03 ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1011 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TPARA , ( CO_DATA )( & AllParaObj ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1011 , 2 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TPARA , ( CO_DATA )( & ComParaObj ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1011 , 3 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TPARA , ( CO_DATA )( & AppParaObj ) }, The single parameters are most likely used within the object directory. The example definition of an object entry is shown for one parameter: { CO_KEY ( 0x1017 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED16 | CO_OBJ____RW ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & Para . App . DemoWord ) }, Domain Definition # This chapter describes the specification of an object with the type domain . The domains are highly application-specific and are usable in a wide range. Example: CO_OBJ_DOM AppDomain = { 0 , sizeof ( APP_PARA_MEM ), & AppParaObj }; This example defines a domain information object for the already allocated memory space of the variable AppParaObj (a variable within the application parameter example). This allows access to the complete application parameter set with SDO segmented or block transfers from within the CANopen network. The following descriptions explains the details of the structure members: The domain offset [ uint32_t ] shall be set to 0 to access the first byte of the domain The domain size [ uint32_t ] in bytes shall be set to the number of bytes within the domain memory area The start address of the domain memory area [ uint8_t * ] shall be set to the first address of the domain The object entry, presenting the example domain above to the CANopen network, should be defined within the manufacturer-specific area (e.g. index 0x2500, subindex 0x00) with the following object directory entry definition line: { CO_KEY ( 0x2500 , 0 , CO_DOMAIN | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TDOMAIN , ( CO_DATA )( & AppDomain ) }, Note: The standard type implementation CO_TDOMAIN assumes, that the domain memory is located in RAM and is direct accessible. For other types of domain, a project-specific domain type shall be implemented. Heartbeat Consumer Definition # This chapter describes the specification of a heartbeat consumer object. Example: CO_HBCONS AppHbConsumer_1 = { 0 }; /* optional somewhere during startup: */ AppHbConsumer_1 . Time = 100 ; /* heartbeat consumer time of 100ms */ AppHbConsumer_1 . NodeId = 42 ; /* heartbeat consumer for node 42 */ This example defines a heartbeat consumer object. The initialization of all members with 0 is good practice, but not mandatory. The heartbeat consumer object allows the configuration of a heartbeat consumer with SDO transfers from within the CANopen network or during configuration time. The following descriptions explains the details of the structure members, which should be initialized (via application - or via an SDO write access): The Time [ uint16_t ] shall be set to the heartbeat consumer time in ms. The monitoring of the addressed heartbeat starts after the first reception of the addressed heartbeat. The NodeId [ uint8_t ] shall be set to the CANopen Node-ID of the heartbeat producer, which shall be consumed. The object entry, presenting the example domain above to the CANopen network, should be defined within the heartbeat consumer area (index 0x1016, subindex 0x01 ff.) with the following object directory entry definition line: { CO_KEY ( 0x1016 , 0 , CO_DOMAIN | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 1 ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1016 , 1 , CO_DOMAIN | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_THB_CONS , ( CO_DATA )( & AppHbConsumer_1 ) }, Note: Even, if the members \"Time\" and \"NodeId\" are static, the heartbeat consumer must be placed in RAM. There are multiple internal members for managing the heartbeat consumer included as well. Emergency Code Definition # This chapter describes the definition of the Emergency error code table. This table must be in line with the Emergency identifier enumeration. Example: const CO_EMCY_TBL AppEmcyCode [ CO_EMCY_N ] = { { CO_EMCY_REG_GENERAL , CO_EMCY_CODE_GEN_ERR + 0x01 }, /* APP_EMCY_1 */ { CO_EMCY_REG_CURRENT , CO_EMCY_CODE_CUR_ERR + 0x01 }, /* APP_EMCY_2 */ { CO_EMCY_REG_VOLTAGE , CO_EMCY_CODE_VOL_ERR + 0x01 }, /* APP_EMCY_3 */ { CO_EMCY_REG_TEMP , CO_EMCY_CODE_TEMP_ERR + 0x01 } /* APP_EMCY_4 */ }; This example defines 4 emergency codes within different error register classes (first entry of each line). The emergency codes itself are based on the standard emergency codes (second entry of each line). The following descriptions explains the details of the table members: The error register bit definition [ uint8_t ] shall be set to one of the following values: Error Register Bit Description CO_EMCY_REG_GENERAL general error (includes all other classes) CO_EMCY_REG_CURRENT error class: current CO_EMCY_REG_VOLTAGE error class: voltage CO_EMCY_REG_TEMP error class: temperature CO_EMCY_REG_COM error class: communication CO_EMCY_REG_PROFILE error class: profile specific error CO_EMCY_REG_MANUFACTURER error class: manufacturer specific The emergency error code [ uint16_t ] shall be set to the application-specific error code. This error code should be defined acc. the CANopen specification. The EMCY handling and object directory manipulations with these definitions is performed by the CANopen stack without further definitions. The application is able to register, clear, reset, check and count emergency errors with the provided function API. For details on this API, see Reference Manual [2]. Example: status = COEmcyGet ( & Node . Emcy , APP_EMCY_1 ); This example gets the current status of the Emergency error with the given emergency identifier APP_EMCY_1 . Object Dictionary # This chapter describes the configuration table representing the CANopen object dictionary. This is the central element of the CANopen node.

The collection of object entries shall be sorted in ascending order in index and subindex. The following chapters describes the details of the table members. Object Entry Key # The object entry key [ uint32_t ] shall be constructed with the following macro: CO_KEY ( < index > , < subindex > , < specification > ) The index is a 16bit value with possible range from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF The subindex is an 8bit value with the possible range from 0x00 to 0xFF Note: to be compliant to the CANopen specification, the defined index and subindex ranges shall be considered. The object specification shall be set to a bitwise disjunction of the listed values for object entry size and the object access mode.

The application is always able to read and write the object entry. When placing the object entry table in read-only memory (with keyword \"const\"), the direct access modes (tread pointer as object entry value), are limited to read-only access, even by the application. Important When using architectures with pointer types lower than 32bit (e.g. 16bit microcontrollers), you can store only values up to the pointer width directly in the object dictionary. For larger values declare a constant variable and place a pointer to this constant into the object dictionary.

Transmit PDO Communication # This chapter describes the PDO communication record for a transmit PDO. The object record contains the following object entries: Index:sub Type Object Type Description 1800h:00 UNSIGNED8 const Communication Object TPDO #0 1800h:01 UNSIGNED32 const or rw with CO_TPDOID COB-ID used by TPDO 1800h:02 UNSIGNED8 const or rw with CO_TPDOTYPE Transmission type 1800h:03 UNSIGNED16 const or rw Inhibit time with LSB 100us (0=disable) 1800h:04 n/a n/a reserved, shall not be implemented 1800h:05 UNSIGNED16 const or rw with CO_TEVENT Event timer LSB 1ms (0=disable) The index identifies which PDO is configured (1800h: TPDO #0, 1801h: TPDO #1, ..., 19ffh: TPDO #511). The object type is const in case of static communication settings. When the communication settings are parameters or dynamic variables, the listed object types ensures the correct change behavior for these records.

Example: const CO_NODE_SPEC AppSpec = { ( uint8_t ) 0x01 , /* pre-defined Node-ID */ ( uint32_t ) Baudrate , /* default baudrate */ ( CO_OBJ * ) & AppObjDir , /* start of object directory */ ( uint16_t ) APP_OBJ_N , /* number of objects in directory */ ( CO_EMCY_TBL * ) & AppEmcyCode , /* start of emergency code table */ ( CO_TMR_MEM * ) & AppTmrMem , /* start of timer manager memory */ ( uint16_t ) APP_TMR_N , /* max. number of timers/actions */ ( uint32_t ) APP_TICKS_PER_SEC , /* timer clock frequency in Hz */ ( CO_IF_DRV ) & AppDrv , /* hardware interface drivers */ ( uint8_t * ) & AppSdoBuf /* start of SDO transfer buffer */ }; This example specifies the basic node information for the example node. Each entry is a part of the configuration. This structure is only required during the startup of the CANopen stack. If SDO block and segmented transfer is disabled, e.g. the SDO transfer buffer is not used, the last entry in the node specification can be set to NULL . The following example creates a single CANopen node: extern const CO_NODE_SPEC AppSpec ; CO_NODE AppNode ; void StartNode ( void ) { CONodeInit ( & AppNode , ( CO_NODE_SPEC * ) & AppSpec ); if ( CONodeGetErr ( & AppNode ) != CO_ERR_NONE ) { /* error handling */ } };","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"usage/configuration/#configuration","text":"","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"usage/configuration/#configuration-options","text":"","title":"Configuration Options"},{"location":"usage/configuration/#application-parameter","text":"This chapter describes the specification of the parameter groups.

The object dictionary of a node is accessible from the network as well as from the node application. The definition of the object dictionary table is done with an array of object entries of the type CO_OBJ . A small example is shown below: const CO_OBJ DemoObjDir [] = { : { CO_KEY ( 0x1001 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED8 | CO_OBJ___PR_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoErrReg ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1005 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ_D__R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( 0x00000080 ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x1014 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ__N_R_ ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoEmcyId ) }, { CO_KEY ( 0x2500 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), 0 , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoVarLong )}, : }; Important The CANopen Stack relies on a binary search algorithm to ensure that object dictionary entries are found quickly. Because of this, you must keep the index / subindex of all entries in the object dictionary sorted in ascending order. Note The object dictionary can manage different object entry types with different properties. This information is encoded within the object entry and is described in detail in the configuration section. The update of the provided basic and system object types within the object dictionary is managed by the CANopen stack. The application may read or write these objects at any time. Use the service function groups CODir\u2026() and COObj\u2026() for accessing the object dictionary. Basic Objects # The read and write access of basic object entries is symmetrical. Therefore the description is reduced to read access. The data width of basic objects is 8bit (byte), 16bit (word) or 32bit (long). All widths are handled in the same way, therefore the description is reduced to 32bit (long) object entries. For simple read access of a (hypothetical) 32bit object entry with an index=0x1234 and subindex=0x56, the service call is: CODirRdLong ( & demo . Dir , CO_DEV ( 0x1234 , 0x56 ), & value ); The following diagram shows the internal behavior of this service. sequenceDiagram participant A as Application participant D as demo.Dir participant O as demo.Obj A->>+D: CODirRdLong() D->>D: CODirFind() D->>+O: read object O-->>-D: value D-->>-A: value For multiple accesses to the same object entry, the following sequence reduces the performance overhead, which is based on searching within the object dictionary. The object read and write functions can take a previously searched object entry as the first argument: CO_OBJ * obj = CODirFind ( & demo . Dir , CO_DEV ( 0x1234 , 0x56 )); do { COObjRdValue ( obj , & value , 4 , 0 ); } while ( value == 0 ); Parameter Objects # The CANopen stack provides service functions, a callback interface and a system object type for managing parameters. The parameters are handled in parameter groups. The parameter group memory must be a consecutive memory area. The recommended way to allocate this memory area is shown in the following example: struct DEMO_PARA_T { uint32_t ParaLong ; /* 32bit demo parameter */ } DemoParaMem ; The parameter group object holds all necessary information, which are needed for the parameter handling. This structure may be placed into ROM because it holds only constant values. const CO_PARA { 0L , /* placement in non-volatile memory */ sizeof ( struct DEMO_PARA_T ), /* size of parameter memory */ & DemoParaMem , /* start address of parameter mem */ & DemoParaDef , /* start address of default para. */ CO_RESET_NODE , /* reset type for reload parameter */ ( void * ) \"DemoParaId\" , /* user parameter identification */ CO_PARA___E /* enable parameter storage on cmd */ } DemoParaObj ; If this parameter group is controllable from the CAN network side, the standard parameter save object (and optionally the parameter load object) is placed into the standard defined location of the object dictionary. The following example shows the object entry for save all parameters : const CO_OBJ DemoObjDir [] = { : { CO_KEY ( 0x1010 , 1 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TPARA , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoParaObj ) }, : }; The parameter values itself can be used within any object directory entry.

The following line stores the given parameter group in NVM. COParaStore ( & DemoParaObj , & demo ); /* store parameter group */ The following diagram shows the internal behavior of storing a parameter object: sequenceDiagram participant A as Application participant P as demo.Para A->>+P: COParaStore() P->>+A: callback CP_SavePara() A-->>-P: ok P-->>-A: ok Domain Objects # The CANopen stack provides a system object type for managing domains.

The recommended way to allocate this memory area is shown in the following example: uint8_t DemoDomainMem [ DEMO_DOMAIN_SIZE ]; /* domain memory area */ The domain object holds all necessary information, which is needed for domain handling. CO_OBJ_DOM DemoDomainObj = { 0 , /* variable for read position */ DEMO_DOMAIN_SIZE , /* size of domain memory */ & DemoDomainMem [ 0 ] /* start address of domain memory */ }; To enable the usage of this domain to the CAN network side, the domain object must be added to the object directory. See the following object entry with index=0x2345 and subindex=0 as an example: const CO_OBJ DemoObjDir [] = { : { CO_KEY ( 0x2345 , 0 , CO_DOMAIN | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TDOMAIN , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoDomainObj ) }, : }; String Objects # The CANopen stack provides a system object type for managing strings. The strings are assumed to be read-only data. The recommended way to allocate this string memory is shown in the following example: const uint8_t DemoString [] = \"Hello World!\" ; /* string memory */ The string object holds all necessary information, which are needed for the string handling. CO_OBJ_STR DemoStringObj = { 0 , /* variable for read position */ & DemoString [ 0 ] /* start address of string memory */ }; To enable the usage of this string to the CAN network side, the string must be added to the object directory. See the following object entry with index=0x3456 and subindex=0 as an example: const CO_OBJ DemoObjDir [] = { : { CO_KEY ( 0x3456 , 0 , CO_STRING | CO_OBJ____R_ ), CO_TSTRING , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoStringObj ) }, : }; User Objects # User type objects are provided to implement special behavior of read and/or write access to an object entry. The complex system types are using this mechanism to provide the specified behavior of several pre-defined CANopen object entries. The implemented access hook functions (called \"type functions\") are used for any access to the object entry, regardless of the accessing component (CAN network via CAN messages or the application via API functions). An example user type (called \"DemoType\") is declared with the following structure. CO_OBJ_TYPE DemoType = { DemoSize , /* type function to get object size */ DemoCtrl , /* type function to control type object */ DemoRead , /* type function to read object content */ DemoWrite /* type function to write object content */ }; If a new user type didn't need to have special behavior on accessing (e.g. get-size, control, read-data or write-data), the corresponding type function can be set to 0 to switch this access to basic behavior. The following list shows the type function prototypes. The return value of the size type function (e.g. DemoSize() ) shall return the size of the user type in bytes. The other type functions shall return CO_ERR_NONE after the successful operation. If an error is detected the corresponding error codes must be returned: CO_ERR_TYPE_RD , CO_ERR_TYPE_WR or CO_ERR_TYPE_CTRL . uint32_t DemoSize ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , uint32_t width ); CO_ERR DemoRead ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , void * buf , uint32_t len ); CO_ERR DemoWrite ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , void * buf , uint32_t len ); CO_ERR DemoCtrl ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , uint16_t id , uint32_t para ); To enable the usage of this demo type to the CAN network side, the demo object must be added to the object directory. See the following object entry with index=0x6789 and subindex=0 as an example: #define CO_TDEMO ((CO_OBJ_TYPE*)&DemoType) const CO_OBJ DemoObjDir [] = { : { CO_KEY ( 0x6789 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TDEMO , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoValue ) }, : }; The following diagram shows the internal behavior of read access to the user type object: sequenceDiagram participant A as Application participant D as demo.Dir participant O as demo.Obj participant T as DemoType A->>+D: CODirRdLong() D->>+O: COObjRdValue() O->>+T: DemoSize() T-->>-O: size O->>+T: DemoCtrl() T-->>-O: ok O->>+T: DemoRead() T-->>-O: value O-->>-D: value D-->>-A: value Implementation Note: The parameter len in the functions DemoRead() and DemoWrite() is the length of the data, given via the pointer buf . If you want to use the width of the object entry, you can use the following snippet: CO_ERR DemoRead ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , void * buf , uint32_t len ) { uint32_t width = CO_GET_SIZE ( obj -> Key ); /* now you can handle your data with: * - size (number of valid buffer data) * - width (number of object entry data) * Note: you can trust, that the indicated SDO transfer size (if given) * is equal to the width (checked by the SDO server) */ } Implementation Note: The internal call to DemoCtrl is performed with the control id CO_CTRL_SET_OFF to set the working offset in domain, string and similar object types. Implementation Note: When you need to control the ABORT codes of SDO expedited transfers, you can use the function COObjTypeUserSDOAbort() to set a user defined SDO abort code within your type functions: CO_ERR DemoWrite ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , void * buf , uint32_t len ) { : if ( /* your write error condition */ ) { /* the given abort code is considered in SDO transfers only! */ COObjTypeUserSDOAbort ( obj , node , 0x12345678 ); return CO_ERR_TYPE_WR ; } : }","title":"Using Object Dictionary"},{"location":"usage/dictionary/#using-object-dictionary","text":"","title":"Using Object Dictionary"},{"location":"usage/dictionary/#object-dictionary","text":"The main interface within the CANopen network is the object dictionary of the CANopen nodes.

See the following object entry with index=0x3456 and subindex=0 as an example: const CO_OBJ DemoObjDir [] = { : { CO_KEY ( 0x3456 , 0 , CO_STRING | CO_OBJ____R_ ), CO_TSTRING , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoStringObj ) }, : };","title":"String Objects"},{"location":"usage/dictionary/#user-objects","text":"User type objects are provided to implement special behavior of read and/or write access to an object entry. The complex system types are using this mechanism to provide the specified behavior of several pre-defined CANopen object entries. The implemented access hook functions (called \"type functions\") are used for any access to the object entry, regardless of the accessing component (CAN network via CAN messages or the application via API functions). An example user type (called \"DemoType\") is declared with the following structure. CO_OBJ_TYPE DemoType = { DemoSize , /* type function to get object size */ DemoCtrl , /* type function to control type object */ DemoRead , /* type function to read object content */ DemoWrite /* type function to write object content */ }; If a new user type didn't need to have special behavior on accessing (e.g. get-size, control, read-data or write-data), the corresponding type function can be set to 0 to switch this access to basic behavior. The following list shows the type function prototypes. The return value of the size type function (e.g. DemoSize() ) shall return the size of the user type in bytes. The other type functions shall return CO_ERR_NONE after the successful operation. If an error is detected the corresponding error codes must be returned: CO_ERR_TYPE_RD , CO_ERR_TYPE_WR or CO_ERR_TYPE_CTRL . uint32_t DemoSize ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , uint32_t width ); CO_ERR DemoRead ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , void * buf , uint32_t len ); CO_ERR DemoWrite ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , void * buf , uint32_t len ); CO_ERR DemoCtrl ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , uint16_t id , uint32_t para ); To enable the usage of this demo type to the CAN network side, the demo object must be added to the object directory. See the following object entry with index=0x6789 and subindex=0 as an example: #define CO_TDEMO ((CO_OBJ_TYPE*)&DemoType) const CO_OBJ DemoObjDir [] = { : { CO_KEY ( 0x6789 , 0 , CO_UNSIGNED32 | CO_OBJ____RW ), CO_TDEMO , ( CO_DATA )( & DemoValue ) }, : }; The following diagram shows the internal behavior of read access to the user type object: sequenceDiagram participant A as Application participant D as demo.Dir participant O as demo.Obj participant T as DemoType A->>+D: CODirRdLong() D->>+O: COObjRdValue() O->>+T: DemoSize() T-->>-O: size O->>+T: DemoCtrl() T-->>-O: ok O->>+T: DemoRead() T-->>-O: value O-->>-D: value D-->>-A: value Implementation Note: The parameter len in the functions DemoRead() and DemoWrite() is the length of the data, given via the pointer buf . If you want to use the width of the object entry, you can use the following snippet: CO_ERR DemoRead ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , void * buf , uint32_t len ) { uint32_t width = CO_GET_SIZE ( obj -> Key ); /* now you can handle your data with: * - size (number of valid buffer data) * - width (number of object entry data) * Note: you can trust, that the indicated SDO transfer size (if given) * is equal to the width (checked by the SDO server) */ } Implementation Note: The internal call to DemoCtrl is performed with the control id CO_CTRL_SET_OFF to set the working offset in domain, string and similar object types. Implementation Note: When you need to control the ABORT codes of SDO expedited transfers, you can use the function COObjTypeUserSDOAbort() to set a user defined SDO abort code within your type functions: CO_ERR DemoWrite ( CO_OBJ * obj , CO_NODE * node , void * buf , uint32_t len ) { : if ( /* your write error condition */ ) { /* the given abort code is considered in SDO transfers only! */ COObjTypeUserSDOAbort ( obj , node , 0x12345678 ); return CO_ERR_TYPE_WR ; } : }","title":"User Objects"},{"location":"usage/emergency/","text":"Emergency Errors # Managing Emergency Errors # The CANopen stack provides service API functions for managing the emergency events within the application.
